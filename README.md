# localsnap
localsnap is a Python script that allows you to download Snap! and run it offline with just a few simple commands.

## Installing
localsnap can be installed by running `pip install localsnap`

localsnap is compatable with both Python 3 and Python 2

## Running
To run localsnap, just run `localsnap` in a terminal, and a web browser running  local version of Snap! will pop up. The first time you do this, localsnap will download Snap! to your computer, so be sure you run this command once when you have internet before you go offline. The localsnap command supports other options, to see these, run `localsnap -h`

Or, if you don't want to mess with a terminal, clicking on the localsnap.py file should work too.
